Introduction
Why This Book?
The digital economy is transforming and evolving at an unprecedented pace. Businesses and investors worldwide are exploring new ways to unlock value, enhance efficiency, and create liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have dominated headlines, the real revolution lies beyond crypto in tokenization.
Tokenization is changing how we invest, trade, and own assets of all kinds. From real estate and stocks to investment funds, intellectual property, and supply chains, businesses are discovering how blockchain-based tokenization can upend entire industries by enhancing accessibility, security, and transparency.
This book is a comprehensive guide for investors, entrepreneurs, and business leaders, helping them grasp the concept of tokenization, understand its strategic advantages, and discover how to utilize it for success.

The Evolution of Digital Assets
The financial sector has undergone multiple waves of digitalisation:
•	Electronic banking and internet-based trading gained momentum in the 1990s.
•	2000s: Fintech innovations (PayPal, mobile banking) and E-commerce
•	2010s: Cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based finance
•	2020s and beyond: Tokenization the next frontier
Tokenization is based on blockchain technology and extends way beyond cryptocurrency and NFTs. It enables businesses to convert physical goods and other types of assets into tokens, revealing revolutionary methods of ownership, investment, and even transactions.

Moving Beyond Cryptocurrency: How Tokenization is Emerging

▪	It converts traditional non-liquid assets such as real estate, private equity, and art into tokens that can be traded.
▪	Security in blockchain ensures transparency, strengthens security and prevents fraud.
▪	Efficiency: Smart contracts automate transactions, reducing costs and intermediaries.
